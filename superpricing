Thoughts about Pricing
	
	  <| <- pricing => 1 orange(.99m)/2oranges(1.50m)/3oranges(2.0m)
	   |	 
	 ooo  <- oranges
	|___| <- basket

	Questions: 
	Does fractional money exist? 
		- It does (see: _.fraction)
		- It can be splitted further down to multiplying the ((0.7-0.85)*amount/weight) with price

	Does/If yes when does rounding take place?
		- donation collection -> before payment, if customer wants to help raise money the cashier can round
		- mostly upwards, downwards probably if item slightly broken

	How to keep an audit trail of pricing desicions (do you need one ?)?
		WHY/WHAT:
		- depends on store and suppliers
			-> maybe my store can get better pricing when we deliver metrics to our suppliers/producers
		- if we have influence on our own pricing, we should definately have some metrics gathering
		- if prices are predefined, just scrape the catalog we get/the excel sheet
		HOW:
		- Elixir: GenServer/GenStateFM
			-> current_prices: [%{product: x, price: y, from: date1, to: date2}]
			-> past_prices: [%{product: x, price: y+1, from: date3, to: date4}, %{product: x, price: y-4, from: date5, to: date6}]
			-> functions: display_price_motion(product) -> produces graph with dates/prices

	Are Prices and Costs the same class of thing?:
		similarities
			- about money
		
		differences
			- prices include the margin of the reseller
				- b2c
			- costs should be the cleaned price for the store
				- b2b

		=> not the same

	If a shelf of 100 cans is priced using “buy two, get one free”, how do you value the stock?
		options:
			one validation for whole stock
			two validations for whole stock and for offer(group them by 3 and calculate only two)
			only the offer is evaluated
			estimates from earlier offers, estimate that if the same amount of customers take the offer, how much do we lose/whats their gain
